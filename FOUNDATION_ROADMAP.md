# AutoGen AI Test Automation - Foundation Roadmap

## üìä Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ What We Have (Working)
1. **Multi-Agent Framework**: 5 specialized AI agents that can communicate
2. **Local AI Integration**: Ollama models working with complete privacy
3. **Agent Orchestration**: Agents can work together in sequence
4. **Basic Test Templates**: Agents generate test code templates
5. **File Parsing**: Can read test scenarios from .txt and .json files
6. **Validation Suite**: Comprehensive tests showing 100% agent functionality

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Missing (Critical Gaps)
1. **Real Test Code Generation**: Currently generates templates, not working tests
2. **Application Understanding**: No way to analyze actual applications
3. **Element Detection**: No automatic selector generation
4. **Test Execution**: Generated tests don't actually run
5. **Integration Testing**: Haven't tested with real applications
6. **Error Handling**: Limited error recovery and debugging

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work Yet
1. **End-to-End Workflow**: From URL to working tests
2. **Real Application Testing**: Only works with manual scenarios
3. **Dynamic Content**: Can't handle modern web applications
4. **Production Deployment**: Not ready for real-world use
