# Dual Support Implementation Todo

## Phase 1: Analyze current framework state and requirements
- [x] Examine current requirements.json structure
- [x] Review test_creation_agent.py implementation
- [x] Check existing page object generation
- [x] Understand current LocatorStrategy usage
- [x] Analyze successful test patterns

## Phase 2: Update requirements.json with framework options
- [x] Add framework_options section
- [x] Include use_page_objects configuration flag
- [x] Maintain backward compatibility

## Phase 3: Implement dual support in test creation agent
- [x] Modify test generation logic to support both approaches
- [x] Add conditional logic based on configuration
- [x] Ensure proper method selection

## Phase 4: Add page object selection and import management logic
- [x] Implement page object discovery and selection
- [x] Add proper import statements for page objects
- [x] Handle page object method calls

## Phase 5: Test both approaches to ensure maintained functionality
- [x] Test direct LocatorStrategy approach (should maintain 100% success) - ✅ PASSED
- [x] Test page object approach - ⚠️ PARTIAL (dual support working, needs refinement)
- [x] Validate configuration switching works - ✅ CONFIRMED

## Phase 6: Document implementation and deliver results
- [ ] Create implementation documentation
- [ ] Provide usage examples
- [ ] Deliver final results to user
