# Gap Analysis & Enhancement Plan

## üìä Current State Assessment (Phase 2 Results)

**Success Rate**: 25%

### ‚úÖ What Works
- **Agent Communication**: Agents can communicate and pass data sequentially.
- **Basic Orchestration**: The orchestrator can run agents in a predefined order.
- **Basic Parsing**: The parser can read the scenario file.

### ‚ùå Critical Gaps
1. **Scenario Parsing**: The parser reads the entire file as one large scenario instead of splitting it into individual test cases. This is the primary reason for the low success rate.
2. **Orchestrator Data Handling**: The orchestrator expects a list of scenarios but receives a single object, causing data structure mismatches and failures.
3. **Test Code Generation**: We still haven't seen what kind of test code is generated because the workflow fails before this step.
4. **No Real Application Interaction**: The framework has no capability to interact with or understand a real application.

## üöÄ Enhancement Plan

### **Priority 1: Fix Scenario Parser** (Immediate)
**Goal**: The parser must correctly identify and extract individual scenarios from the text file.

**Tasks**:
1. **Modify `parsers/txt_parser.py`**: Implement logic to split the file content by "Scenario X:" or a similar delimiter.
2. **Extract Scenario Details**: For each scenario, extract the name, description, steps, and expected results.
3. **Create Unit Tests**: Add unit tests for the parser to ensure it works with various file formats and edge cases.

### **Priority 2: Fix Orchestrator Data Flow** (Immediate)
**Goal**: The orchestrator must handle the list of scenarios correctly and pass them to the agents.

**Tasks**:
1. **Modify `complete_orchestrator.py`**: Ensure the orchestrator iterates through the list of scenarios from the parser.
2. **Update Agent Inputs**: Make sure each agent receives one scenario at a time or a list of scenarios as expected.
3. **Add Integration Tests**: Create tests to validate the data flow from the parser to the orchestrator and then to the agents.

### **Priority 3: Validate Test Code Generation** (Next)
**Goal**: See what kind of test code is actually generated and if it's usable.

**Tasks**:
1. **Run the fixed workflow**: Execute the complete workflow with the fixed parser and orchestrator.
2. **Analyze Generated Code**: Inspect the generated test files to see if they are templates or real code.
3. **Identify Gaps**: Determine what's missing in the generated code (selectors, assertions, waits, etc.).

### **Priority 4: Build Discovery Agent** (Future)
**Goal**: Enable the framework to understand web applications automatically.

**Tasks**:
1. **Create `agents/discovery_agent.py`**: Build a new agent that can crawl a web page.
2. **Implement Basic Analysis**: Extract links, forms, and buttons from a page.
3. **Integrate with Orchestrator**: Add a new "discovery" step to the workflow.

## üìÖ Implementation Timeline

- **This Week**: Focus on fixing the parser and orchestrator (Priorities 1 & 2).
- **Next Week**: Validate test code generation and identify gaps (Priority 3).
- **Following Weeks**: Start building the Discovery Agent (Priority 4).

By following this plan, we will address the critical gaps in our foundation and move towards a truly autonomous testing framework.
